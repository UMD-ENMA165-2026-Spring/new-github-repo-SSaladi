# The Markdown document I made for the github repo assignment
## *Below are the choices i made when setting up the repo*
1. I chose to make this repository public because it would be much easier to submith the assignment
2. i chose to start with no template because i wanted to make the other choices in the assignment
3. i chose to add a README because i just wanted to have one
4. i chose to add a gitignore and chose to make it in the python language because why not
5. i added an MIT license because thats just what i always do
## this part if for the flavored markdown
i will enjoy the :football: game tommorow 
this is a mention to Professor @guyer
>[!warning]
>this document is only used for the first assignment
